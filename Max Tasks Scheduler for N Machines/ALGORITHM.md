Max Tasks Scheduler for N Machines
==================================

<h3>
Statement :
</h3>
Given 'n' tasks, where each task is pair of start time and finish time.
Schedule maximum number of tasks using <b>'n'</b> processors.

<h4>
Idea :
</h4>
Take first processor, and apply schedule task finishing first strategy.
Apply same for second processor on remaining unscheduled tasks.

<h4>
Note :
</h4>
Proof of correctness is yet to be figured out. Scrutinize and write algorithm details for it.

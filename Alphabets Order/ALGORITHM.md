==============

<h3>
Statement :
</h3>
Set of strings are given in a dictionary order. The problem here is order is not as our alphabetical. It may be different. C may come before a,b, x may come before d,c. etc. You will have to find the order of characters by using given input. (topological sort â€“ complete code is required to write)
